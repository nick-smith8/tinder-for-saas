Please build a tinder for saas page for me.  The following requirements should be implemented:
1. The page should follow a 3 column design utilizing flex for the styling.  The left column is the ‘swipe left’ column, middle column is the column that will show a card for the software supplier, the right column is the ‘swipe right’ column.
2. The cards in the middle columns should be draggable to the ‘swipe left’ or swipe right column.  If a card is dragged into one of these columns then there should be an alert that shows the supplier name that was dragged into that column
3. The middle software cards should show the supplier name and a supplier logo
4. You should implement the logic for the state handlers when a card is dragged from the middle column
5. You should have a base array of suppliers that is filled with objects that have a name / logo which the middle column will show
